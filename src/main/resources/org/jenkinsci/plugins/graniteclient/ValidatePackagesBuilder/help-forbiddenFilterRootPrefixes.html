<div>
    List of path prefixes which are forbidden to be the same path or an ancestor of any workspace filter root.
    Surrounding whitespace and trailing slashes are ignored and the prefix is treated as an atomic path. For example:<br/>
    <br/>
    <pre>/apps/system</pre><br/>
    will fail a package defining a filter root of <pre>/apps/system/config</pre><br/>
    but it will not fail a package filter covering only <pre>/apps/systemOfADown/config</pre>
    <br/>
    Use this test to safeguard entire repository trees from package installation or uninstallation.<br/>
    <br/>
    This field supports parameter tokens.
